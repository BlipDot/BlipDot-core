# BlipDot-core
This is the main android app


Game Idea:
Dots pop up on the screen randomly
Each dot has an expiry timing (eg: 3 seconds, 5 seconds, etc) after which the dot disappears.
The user has to press the dot until the dot time runs out/the dot expires.
If the user touches any white spaces, he/she loses.
The dots can have random shape and random size (eg: triangle of 10 pixels)
To increase difficulty, the time length and number of dots increase (maximum number of dots being 10 obviously)
By pressing something like a “god dot”, all the dots on the screen disappear temporarily and the score of the user increases.
The “God dot” would have a special color and shape.
It would definitely be hard to reach the “God dot”, otherwise the game would be simple.
The “God dot” must appear only when the number of dots on the screen exceeds 7 or 8.
There would be an impossible level, where the “God dot” appears only after the number of dots exceeds 10. (In the impossible level the number of dots SHOULD exceed 10) 
Make sure to make a tutorial page before starting the game.
First level would be just 1 dot for the duration of about 2 seconds.
Add a timer above the dot so that the user knows the time left.
Once the “God dot” shows up, the user just needs to tap it to utilize.
Dots must not spawn in a 10 pixel radius of other dots.


Alternate :
No levels, the user plays as long as he/she can i.e until the user gets eliminated.
No god dot.
The dots start moving after a certain amount of points or time.
The user has to just tap the dots.
