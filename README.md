# BlipDot-core
This is the main android app


<h2>Game Idea:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Dots pop up on the screen randomly</li>
<li>Each dot has an expiry timing (eg: 3 seconds, 5 seconds, etc) after which the dot disappears.</li>
<li>The user has to press the dot until the dot time runs out/the dot expires.</li>
<li>If the user touches any white spaces, he/she loses.</li>
<li>The dots can have random shape and random size (eg: triangle of 10 pixels)</li>
<li>To increase difficulty, the time length and number of dots increase (maximum number of dots being 10 obviously)</li>
<li>By pressing something like a “god dot”, all the dots on the screen disappear temporarily and the score of the user increases.</li>
<li>The “God dot” would have a special color and shape.</li>
<li>It would definitely be hard to reach the “God dot”, otherwise the game would be simple.</li>
<li>The “God dot” must appear only when the number of dots on the screen exceeds 7 or 8.</li>
<li>There would be an impossible level, where the “God dot” appears only after the number of dots exceeds 10. (In the impossible level the number of dots SHOULD exceed 10) </li>
<li>Make sure to make a tutorial page before starting the game.</li>
<li>First level would be just 1 dot for the duration of about 2 seconds.</li>
<li>Add a timer above the dot so that the user knows the time left.</li>
<li>Once the “God dot” shows up, the user just needs to tap it to utilize.</li>
<li>Dots must not spawn in a 10 pixel radius of other dots.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Alternate:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>No levels, the user plays as long as he/she can i.e until the user gets eliminated.</li>
<li>No god dot.</li>
<li>The dots start moving after a certain amount of points or time.</li>
<li>The user has to just tap the dots.</li>
</ol>
